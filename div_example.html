      <p>Our star, the Sun, is a middle-aged yellow star that is more massive than the average star.<br>
        It is a star that nurtures and supports life on Earth. Its heat and light warm Earth’s surface,<br>
        drive phenomena such as weather and ocean currents,andfuel photosynthesis.<br>
        We experience the Sun’s energy every time we feel its warmth on our skin or see with the aid of its light.</p>
